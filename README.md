#SkyBox
Skyrim mod that allow items to be shared between different playthroughs. Any number of in-game chests can be turned into a Stash, which means its contents will be persistent no matter which character you are playing. This is still in development.

##Why is this not Familiar Faces?
Because I burned out on FF and needed to do something different for a while. In the process I wanted to completely redo the way FF handles saving and loading data, and SuperStash/SkyBox became my learning project for implementing that. Many features developed for SkyBox have already been backported to FF, and believe me, that's a good thing.
